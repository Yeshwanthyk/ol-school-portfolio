# Ol' School Portfolio

All of the modern portfolios for showcasing photographic bodies of work seems to be modernised to show images horizontally. This makes them work really well in mobile view. But, this really destroys the carefully planned rhythm of the sequence of images. So, I made this project instead.

A no-frills and highly performant portfolio using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [cloudinary](cloudinary.com/)
